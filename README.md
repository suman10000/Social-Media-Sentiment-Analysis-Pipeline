## ⚙ Data Pipeline Flow

### 🔄 Batch ETL

```
Extract → Clean → Transform → Sentiment Scoring → Load
```

- Removes noise (URLs, mentions, symbols)
- Applies VADER sentiment scoring
- Generates structured dataset
- Builds surrogate keys for dimensions
- Constructs fact table

---

### 🗄 Data Warehouse Layer

Star Schema Implementation:

**Fact Table**
- fact_sentiment

**Dimension Tables**
- dim_user
- dim_date
- dim_platform
- dim_location

Designed for efficient OLAP-style analytical querying.

---

## 📈 Analytics Capabilities

Examples of insights generated:

- 📊 Sentiment distribution by date
- 📅 Rolling 7-day sentiment average
- 🏆 Most negative days ranking
- 📈 Trend analysis using window functions
- 🔍 Sentiment segmentation by platform/location
- ⚡ Hybrid Spark + Snowflake analytics

---

## 🔐 Security & Governance

Implemented using enterprise design principles:

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Secure View-based column masking
- Schema-level privilege management
- Separation of administrative roles
- Least privilege enforcement model

---

## ⚡ Big Data & Streaming

### 🚀 Apache Spark Batch Processing

- Aggregates sentiment counts
- Computes daily averages
- Handles 1.6M+ records efficiently

### 🔄 Structured Streaming (Simulation)

- Real-time sentiment aggregation simulation
- Micro-batch processing model
- Continuous sentiment monitoring concept

---
